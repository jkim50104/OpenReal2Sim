# Real-to-Sim Robotic Simulation

This directory contains the code and resources necessary to set up a robotic simulation environment that mirrors real-world scenarios, using the reconstructed assets from the [reconstruction](../reconstruction/README.md) step.

Current supported physics simulators:

- [x] IssacLab ([IssacLab v2.0.2](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/v2.0.2/source/setup/ecosystem.html) & [IssacSim v4.5.0](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/index.html))
- [x] Maniskills
- [ ] Mujoco
