## Workflow

### object segmentation

We first need to segment the objects and the ground (for gravity alignment) in the scene.

With the object and ground masks, we can reconstruct the 3D meshes of each object and the background in the following steps.

We use the tool `tools/segmentation_annotator.py` to segment and annotate the video.

### background pixel inpainting

We conduct background pixel inpainting to fill in missing regions in the background after object segmentation.

The inpainted background image will serve as the texture for the background mesh. (See `modules/background_pixel_inpainting.py`)

### background point inpainting

We inpaint the background point cloud to fill in missing regions (by depth estimation or ground plane assumption) and then generate a complete 3D background mesh. (See `modules/background_point_inpainting.py`)

### background mesh generation

We generate the 3D mesh of the background using the inpainted point cloud and texture. This step produces a complete background mesh that can be used in the final scene. (See `modules/background_mesh_generation.py`)

### object mesh generation

We generate the 3D mesh of each object using the segmented masks and input images. This step produces complete object meshes that can be used in the final scene. (See `modules/object_mesh_generation.py`)

### scenario construction

We assemble the object and background meshes together to form the complete scene.

Specifically, we resize and register the object mesh to the correct position in the scene using metric image point cloud. Then, we rotate the scene (background+objects) mesh so the ground plane is aligned with the gravity Z direction. (See `modules/scenario_construction.py`)

### scenario fdpose optimization

We use Foundation Pose to futher optimize the object placement and track the object trajectory in a video. (See `modules/scenario_fdpose_optimization.py`)

### scenario collision optimization

We optimize the object placement to avoid collisions between objects and the background. (See `modules/scenario_collision_optimization.py`)

## How to Use

Make sure you have `scene.pkl` (from preprocess steps) in the `outputs/{key_name}/scene` folder.

We first need to segment objects that needs to be reconstructed. We provide a GUI for this purpose:
```
python openreal2sim/reconstruction/tools/segmentation_annotator.py
```

If everything is ready, run the all-in-one reconstruction script:
```
python openreal2sim/reconstruction/recon_agent.py
```

You can also start from a certain stage using the `--stage` argument:
```
python openreal2sim/reconstruction/recon_agent.py --stage scenario_construction 
```
The `stage` argument can be set to one of the following:
[object_segmentation, background_pixel_inpainting, background_point_inpainting, background_mesh_generation, object_mesh_generation, scenario_construction, scenario_fdpose_optimization]

You can also run individual stages separately, for example:
```
python modules/background_pixel_inpainting.py
```


## Outputs

We will obtain `outputs/{key_name}/scene/scene.pkl` and `outputs/{key_name}/scene/scene.json` that contains all necessary scene information:
